## Project Description 

This project serves as a demonstration of how to implement a scalable, performance by using Python with FastAPI framework. The app provieds the essential functionalities needed for managing an online store, including product catalog management, user accounts, and order processing. 

### Project Goals 

- **High Performance**: Leverage FastAPI to acheieve high performance and low latency for API requests. FastAPI's asynchronous capabilities and automatic data validation ensure that the app can handle a large number of concurrent requests efficiently.
- **Scalability**: Design the application to be modular and scalable. This includes separating concerns into different components like services, routes, and schemas.
- **Ease of Use**: Provide a user-friendly API with automatic interactive documentation using Swagger UI and ReDoc.


### Key Features
 
- **Product Management**:
    - **CRUD Operations**: Create, read, update, and delete products.
    - **Product Search**: Search and filter products based on various criteria such as category, price, and availability. 

- **User Management**:
  - **User Registration and Authentication**: Users can register, log in.
  - **Profile Management**: Users can update their personal information and manage their preferences. ***Add this feature later***

- **Order Processing**:
  - **Order Creation**: Users can create new orders and add products to their cart.
  - **Order Tracking**: Users can view the status of their orders and track their shipment. ***Add this feature later***

- **Integration with Database**:
  - **Persistent Storage**: Utilize SQLite for storing data related to products, users, and orders. The database schema is designed to support efficient queries and data integrity.
  - **Data Models**: Define data models using SQLAlchemy ORM to facilitate interaction with the database.


### Architecture 

The application follows a modular architecture to promote maintainability and scalability:

- **API Routes**: Organized into different modules under the `route` directory, each handling specific endpoints (e.g., product, user, order).
- **Services**: Contain the business logic of the application, separated from the API route handlers.
- **Schemas**: Define the data models and validation rules used for request and response bodies.
- **Database Models**: Define the structure of the data stored in the database and handle interactions using SQLAlchemy.

### Future Enhancements

- **Payment Integration**: Add support for integrating with payment gateways to handle transactions.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Implement a web-based admin interface for managing products, orders, and users.
- **Enhanced Search**: Improve the product search functionality with more advanced features like full-text search and recommendations.
- **Deployment**: Provide instructions and configurations for deploying the application to cloud platforms such as AWS or Azure.

## Future Implementations

Several enhancements are planned to further improve the application:

- **Redis**: Implement Redis as a caching layer to boost performance by reducing database load and improving response times. This will enable faster retrieval of frequently accessed data and enhance overall application efficiency.

- **Grafana & Prometheus**: Integrate Grafana and Prometheus for advanced monitoring and observability. Prometheus will collect and store metrics, while Grafana will provide real-time visualizations and dashboards to monitor the application's health and performance.

- **NginX**: Use NginX as a load balancer to distribute incoming traffic across multiple instances of the application. This will enhance the application's ability to handle high traffic volumes, improve fault tolerance, and ensure better availability.

- **PostgreSQL**: Transition from SQLite to PostgreSQL for enhanced scalability and performance. PostgreSQL will provide advanced features such as robust transaction management, concurrency control, and support for complex queries. This migration will involve updating the database schema and adjusting application configurations to ensure smooth integration with PostgreSQL.
